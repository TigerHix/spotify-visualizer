Basically I wanted something nice to be displayed on my TV while coding, like a spotify music visualizer (album art with artist / title and visualizer on top).

Hacked this by merging those two project ([webgl-spotify-connect-now-playing-screen-example](https://github.com/plamere/webgl-spotify-connect-now-playing-screen-example) and [visualizer](https://github.com/ianharmon/visualizer)) so kudos to them!

Run in HTML5 by listening to the microphone for the visualizer (use `stereo mix` in windows or `soundflower` in mac to route your speaker to the microphone). Use Spotify Connect API to get the album art / title / etc.
